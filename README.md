# Simple-LG-TV-Websocket-HTML-interface
Interface with your late-model LG TV through websockets all while utilizing a single HTML file!

## Usage
Modify the IP address (and port if needed) at the top of the HTML file to whatever is assigned to your TV. Then go to the HTML file you just downloaded and run it through your browser. Click "Connect", then click "GetClientKey", go to your TV and verify that want this application accessing your TV, then click "VerifyClientKey". You are now free to perform other commands. If you need to disconnect, you can always click the "VerifyClientKey" button again to easily reconnect without having to re-pair. If you reload the screen, you will lose the cached client key and will need to pair again.
